# Why does this exist?
I made this because i wanted to have a simple way to organise emulators and roms into one place. You may say *"Why not use RetroArch then?"* and that's a valid argument. My response is that i don't like RetroArch's gui and, more importantly atleast for me, **RetroArch performs way worse**. While i have a moderately good desktop which runs RetroArch just fine, i also have multiple low-end laptops (2GB of RAM, Dual Core proccessor) that run standalone emulators no problem but struggle *heavily* with RetroArch. Plus they both run linux and navigating file browsers and such on such low-end laptops is a very slow and, to an extent, painful process even after replacing the default desktop environments (no i don't like using stuff like i3 WM). However, typing in commands in a terminal is much faster and easier for me personally. And since i couldn't find any tools or utilites that matched with my wants, i DIY'd one myself.

# Installation
Make a folder somewhere, name it whatever and drop the script in there. Why have a seperate folder? Cause the script makes it's own folders and idk just don't forget about the folder it creates otherwise put it wherever you want.

After that just run the script in a terminal, it should automatically call --help command and list all available commands.
